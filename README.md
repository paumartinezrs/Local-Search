This project is realized through the application of artificial intelligence algorithms, specifically Hill Climbing and Simulated Annealing, with the aim of developing the optimal bike transport planning for the Bicing service between different urban stations. The objective is to collect bikes from stations with low demand forecasts and transport them to those where they are needed most urgently, all while seeking to minimize the costs associated with transportation.
